Featured on Radiohead’s 1997 alternative-rock classic OK Computer, “Let Down” was recorded at 3 AM in a ballroom at the historic St Catherine’s Court. The song structure features multi-layered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano, with unconventional time signatures and a Spector-esque “Wall of Sound”.
Thom Yorke explained,
Sentimentality is being emotional for the sake of it. We’re bombarded with sentiment, people emoting. That’s the Let Down. Feeling every emotion is fake. Or rather every emotion is on the same plane whether it’s a car advert or a pop song.
Jonny Greenwood added,
Andy Warhol once said that he could enjoy his own boredom. ‘Let Down’ is about that. It’s the transit-zone feeling. You’re in a space, you are collecting all these impressions, but it all seems so vacant. You don’t have control over the earth anymore. You feel very distant from all these thousands of people that are also walking there.
(from Humo magazine July 22, 1997)

Lead singer Thom Yorke, guitarist Ed O'Brien, and producer Nigel Godrich discussed the conception of the track and how it was recorded as part of an in-depth oral history of OK Computer for a Rolling Stone article:
Yorke: That came from being in the bubble and looking at things as they passed by me. If you spend all your time time traveling on airplanes or on buses or whatever, you’re bound to get this sense like in “Let Down.” It’s like hanging onto something and having the floors collapse underneath you.""
O'Brien: Thom used to demo a lot of stuff on tour, and we recorded at soundcheck, too. With “Let Down,” I remember us playing on Easter Monday on the Bends tour. Thom had done a demo of the song and we were in this place with lots of reverb. And it was like, “Oh, this makes sense.” It was recorded live without people recording overdubs. A lot of that record was recorded live.""
Godrich: We recorded that in the orangery. If you go to a recording studio, the best thing you’re going to get is the kind of clichéd video of people in the studio, you know? But if I set you up in that corner here, you’ll always remember this room and you’ll be inspired by that plant or whatever. It brings a different sort of thing to it."""

“Electric Feel” is about sex and the “electric” sensations it provides. It also uses electricity to refer to love, and mentions how worldwide love would change the world.
It is MGMT’s second single from the album, Oracular Spectacular, and was named #5 on NME’s Top Singles of 2008 list. This track also appeared in three different video games and two TV shows.
This song really shows just how MGMT is taking the Hippie music of the 60’s and 70’s in a new, modern direction.

A lot of times when we write songs we have had some kind of influence or a style that we really want to put into our music. Like, we’ll say let’s have that part sound like this and that part sound like that and then we piece it all together. We didn’t plan anything, it was more of a song by song thing. We tend to be inspired a lot by artists that switch genres each album. Each song is different. ‘Legendary Pink Dots‘ are like that. When we were writing the album they were a big influence. We literally just wrote whatever came to us. There is a weird combination on the album because it has a couple of older tracks on it which were originally electronic with a more dancey feel. ‘Electric Feel‘ was one of the first songs we wrote, well the first actual song with lyrics.

MGMT have described the lyrics to “Time to Pretend” as:
We wrote “Time to Pretend” our senior year of college, and the music was inspired by a praying mantis we had in our house. She laid eggs and it died, and we laid the egg case on this kinda model pirate ship on the mantelpiece, and the eggs hatched and all these baby praying mantises were climbing up the rigging of the ship, and it was pretty crazy… uhm so the music was inspired by our praying mantis that liked to dance to The Clash {laugh} and the lyrics are just about us imagining being rock stars… and yeah, fantasy rock star life.
The song has featured in various films and television shows, including Skins, Saltburn, and the 2016 trailer for Spider-Man: Homecoming. “Time to Pretend” was ranked #493 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

“Sweater Weather” is the lead single from The Neighbourhood’s 2012 debut EP I’m Sorry…, and also features on their debut full-length album I Love You.
“Sweater Weather” is one of The Neighbourhood’s most successful tracks, peaking at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in December 2013 and spent 11 weeks at #1 on the Alternative charts. The music video for the track reached 100 million views in December 2015, when the video was merely two years old.
“Sweater Weather” is the first song the band had ever written together, composed during their first practice, around a year prior to its release. Frontman Jesse Rutherford recalled the historic day to Schon! in December 2015:
It was just a really special moment and it felt special before anybody said it was special. When we first wrote it and showed our families and some friends that we trusted their opinion around town or whatever, it was just a different reaction than we’d ever seen someone have to our music.

[Sweater Weather] has done so much for us and it’s a super solid song, but it was the first one we wrote. We have grown a lot and have gotten our sound more locked in since that song. It still feels right alongside all the other songs but it definitely is the hardest one to put other tracks around.
–Jesse Rutherford via Swide.com on the struggle of articulating his feelings into lyrics on “Sweater Weather”
On June 1, 2013, “Sweater Weather” peaked at #1 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart. It spent 11 weeks at the top spot overall."

“Heat Waves” is the fourth single from UK band Glass Animals' third studio album Dreamland. The song features a melancholy tone but maintains high energy through its instrumental, with Dave speaking on remaining strong through vulnerable moments in your life and embracing your vulnerability.
The band first teased the track along their 2020 Déjà Vu Tour, as seen on the setlist for the Toronto show on the tour. Dave then teased the song’s release and chorus lyrics on the band’s subreddit on June 26, 2020. It was later premiered as Annie Mac’s Hottest Record in the World on BBC Radio 1 on June 29, 2020.

After the song released, Dave published a note to fans on Twitter:
HEAT WAVES IS OUT NOW. it’s about realising you can’t make everyone happy. and realising it’s ok to be defeated by something. we are often expected to ‘be strong’ and to swallow our sadness. failing to do that is seen as weakness. so we try to cover up our feelings and hide inside of TV shows or video games or drink or drugs. but being vulnerable should be a positive thing. there was a review in a big publication we got early on that said i was ‘too effeminate’ because of the way I sang and that that was weak and gross. its 2020. there’s no space for that sh*t anymore. the music video is out too. it’s meant to reference the sentiments in the song…about being defeated and unable to save something…but tweaked the context a little. I’ll do another post about it tomorrow explaining more. i hope you like the song, its a special one to me.
He expanded on the meaning in the Apple Music Editor’s Notes:
It began with a personal experience that everyone has had: A friend starts dating someone and slowly, they change the way they dress. And then the way they talk. And then everything. Eventually it gets to the point where you’re like, ‘Who is that? Where did my friend go?’ Well, this song is about realizing that it’s happened to you, that it’s you that’s changed. You’ve become someone that you aren’t. I was trying to figure out whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, but ultimately I think it’s about hitting a wall—a point where you can’t change anymore or you’ll lose the foundation of who you are. You’ll become an attachment for this other person. It’s happened to me and I’ve seen it happen to so many friends. And there’s a moment when you see your reflection and you’re like, ‘Oh, fuck.’ All of the lyrics play into that—mirages, hallucinations, things like that.
He revealed more about the video’s meaning on YouTube:
this video is a love letter to live music and the culture and togetherness surrounding it. It was filmed at the peak of the lockdown in my neighbourhood in East London by the lovely people who live around me, just using their phones. These are people who are usually out at shows, in galleries, going to cinemas etc. These venues are left empty now, and many of them will not survive. The song is about loss and longing, and ultimately realizing you are unable to save something…and this video is about that but for art, being together, and human contact. Huge love and thank you’s to everyone who got involved and helped out. When everyone was leaning out of their windows filming, I felt that same sense of togetherness and spine-tingling energy that happened at live shows. It made the coldness of performing to an empty room with the band stuck on screens feel even more heart-breaking
Yes, it was certified platinum on April 28, 2021 making it their second song to do so."

On the final song of Currents, the narrator admits that his metamorphosis should be read with caution – its biggest skeptic is the side of him he left behind.
The impulse to change and the fear of changing too much are at odds until the bridge, which suggests some synthesis: “This story ain’t so different from the rest.” Change and self-doubt are natural, and in the end the narrator is the same introspective person he was on Innerspeaker and Lonerism.
It’s a fitting conclusion to an album that both describes personal transformation and embodies it musically, as a radical departure from Kevin Parker’s earlier work. Both fans and artist are forced to reconcile the past with the present, and the “realization” that one person can express different aspects of themself at different times “is as good as it gets.”
This song was covered by Rihanna on her album, ANTI, under the title “Same Ol' Mistakes.”
This song was also used in teasers for FX’s show created by Donald Glover, Atlanta. Glover is also known as the rapper Childish Gambino.

“Midnight City” is off of M83’s sixth, and critically acclaimed album Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming (Naive, 2011). The song’s catchiness quickly made it one of the most popular songs of the year, appearing on the top of many “Best of” lists. The song is a tribute to city life and the city itself, especially how it comes alive during the nighttime.
Anthony Gonzalez’s comment on the use of the saxophone:
Sometimes a song needs an element to be finished. You know that this element has been overused in the past and is considered clichéd or cheesy, but the song needs it. With this album, the whole idea was to do something and have no regrets.
The music video is a tribute to the movies Village of the Damned and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

From FLOOD magazine, frontman Dave Bayley explained, “If you’ve ever said something that you know is going to break that person, then you say it, and it’s almost like an out-of-body experience, and it feels like it’s not you saying it…but then it comes out,” says Bayley. “It’s about the three seconds between you saying it, and then there’s that silence—but it’s also the loudest thing that’s ever happened in your life.”

From the band’s Instagram post:
This entire song is about only three seconds of life. I think most people have been in a position where they have to say something to someone that they know is going to devastate them and change their life forever. It’s about the silence between those words leaving your mouth, and their reaction as those words register and the full weight rolls over them…until they say something back. its probably the most deafening thing I’ve ever experienced. the video is meant to be a physical representation of the build up before that and then the sudden explosion of quiet that seems to last forever.
From the album’s Apple Music page:
This song is about saying something that you know is going to really hurt somebody—something they’ll never forgive you for and that will probably make them hate you—and the three seconds right after you say those words. That silence that feels like the loudest fucking thing ever. I began with a particular moment in mind, but then I just started thinking back on all the times I’ve been…well, maybe not a dick, but close. All the times I’ve hurt somebody, and sitting with what that felt like. It’s quite abstract compared to the rest of the songs on the record because I wanted it to apply to a lot of situations."

“Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth” is about looking back at yourself at the beginning of a relationship and recognising that you were acting completely different to normal. The song was the first to be written for Dreamland after it’s title track. The final version is actually the demo, as the band had tried to re-record it, but ended up sticking with the original.
In the Glass Animals listening party, Bayley says
Someone once told me that for the first 3 months of a relationship, you play a fake version of yourself…I think we spend a lot of time not being ourselves because we think who we are isn’t good enough, so we hide our real selves when actually it would be much better to just be open and honest from the beginning.

“Your Love (Déjà Vu),” described by band frontman Dave Bayley as a “conflicted booty-call anthem,” is about toxic relationships that you know are bad for you but can’t seem to cut off.
Speaking to Annie Mac during the song’s premiere on BBC Radio 1’s Future Sounds, the band’s lead singer and songwriter Dave Bayley explained that he has recently made a major shift from the band’s usual abstract lyrics to more personal ones. He went on to explain that “Your Love” is about a dysfunctional relationship and stated:
“[E]veryone’s got relationships, not necessarily romantic ones, in their lives and they know that that person is kind of bad; it’s an unhealthy relationship – but you keep letting that person back into your life. Either because you think it’s going to change, or because something deeper, darker – you’re addicted to the chaos of that relationship. That’s what this is about – being addicted to the mess.”
Naturally, much of this interview focused on the elephant in the room: drummer Joe Seaward’s life-threatening cycling accident which left him unable to walk or speak–much less play drums–for over a year. His injuries forced Glass Animals to cancel all scheduled tour dates and take an extended hiatus. Initially, the band stayed with him for several weeks. Eventually as Joe’s healing progressed Dave went to the United States where he worked on some solo and collaborative writing and producing projects. He said that working with hip-hop artists who tended to write very personal lyrics inspired him to take a more personal approach to songwriting as well. Thus, the incident that threatened to destroy the band ended up being a catalyst for creative change.
The song first made its live debut during Glass Animals' comeback show at The Bullingdon in late 2019 where the setlist called it “Palm Mute”. Fans in attendance reported that the band  requested for them not to post any videos of this performance online as they were still a bit rusty. They honored the request.
“Your Love (Déjà Vu)” was confirmed to be a single from Glass Animals' upcoming third album, Dreamland, before the album was officially announced.

Dave’s quotes in Dork Magazine expand on the song’s subject:
“I think we’ve all found ourselves in fucked up relationships that make us feel sad and helpless. Not necessarily something romantic – maybe it’s with a family member or a friend. A relationship that we know on some level is going to keep breaking our hearts. We let that person back into their [sic] lives over and over again, even though it always ends the same. Maybe you don’t confront it because you hope it’ll change with time. Or because it’s easier to let it slide and never set boundaries. maybe you think you deserve that unhappiness. Or maybe you find some strange comfort in the chaos.
This song is about that…about being addicted to chaos. About doing or allowing something self-destructive because on some level you get off on the sadness that comes of it. It’s about wanting to float around and exist inside of that feeling because it has always been familiar to you. It’s something that a lot of people know from growing up in a tense household…so it can feel right to create that dynamic, even if you don’t realise you’re doing it.”
Glass Animals explained it with a tweet
…it’s two identical takes. one with a thermal camera. one normal. layered on top of each other. i have a bath. and then i sit in a car even tho i don’t actually have a driving license. and we dance around.

“Melon and the Coconut” depicts a Melon and a Coconut breaking up with each other.
Bayley claims “I really like using food as characters. I think all food has a personality. someone’s favourite food says a lot about them.
After waking up from a nap, Bayley wrote and recorded this song in about an hour. Attempts were made to add more to it, however Bayley enjoyed the rawness of the song and felt adding more made it lose its charm.
When recording, Bayley accidentally left his security camera on and found himself with nearly two hours of footage of him playing around his studio. “I watched it back the other day,” he says. “I’m sitting there with my feet up playing the guitar and singing into a microphone. Maybe we need to cut that up for a video. I do some weird shit.”

Dave for Atwood Magazine:
I liked putting it in the middle ’cause it’s about these two characters, but really I’ve been both of those characters. I’ve been both of those places, kind of both sides of the argument. I don’t know. And then yeah, then you have the second half of the album. There’s something, I don’t know, symmetrical about that song ’cause it was one verse by the melon one verse by the… Yeah, anyway.
For Floor Magazine:
I just like how that one came out, just fast and really fun. There’s a spontaneous charm about it, and then we tried to fuck with it—like, put a big beat under it and stuff—and that didn’t really work, so we just left it in super demo form."

“Space Ghost Coast To Coast” combines bits and pieces of millennial childhood nostalgia with musings on school shootings. Frontman Dave Bayley explained to Flood and The Independent that the song was inspired by the fact that his childhood friend was caught attempting to plan a school shooting.
The band first began teasing the track along their 2020 Déjà Vu Tour, as seen on the setlist for one of the Boston show on the tour.

Dave Bayley wrote for the Apple Music Editor’s notes:
I’ve tried to tell this story somewhat vaguely because I hate the idea of revealing someone’s identity, and this person in particular has rebuilt themselves, which is an incredible thing. This song is about a very good friend I had growing up, back in those formative years when I was first discovering hip-hop—Eminem, Busta Rhymes, Missy Elliott, all of whom I tried to channel in the production—and also discovering myself. We went to camp together, we got into trouble together, but we were both always nervous and shy about everything. There was gentleness to it all. When my family moved to England, we fell out of touch, and a couple of years later I found out that he’d brought a gun to school and tried to do a shooting. He got caught on the way in, no one died, but it affected me. It didn’t add up in my head. He was the person I watched cartoons with and played kickball with… I couldn’t understand it. It was the first time I really understood how much things can change, that people you love can do things that you won’t understand. It was a breaking of innocence.
For Flood Magazine:
It’s when someone who you think you’ll always trust, even if you’re not in contact, does something that you think is unspeakably horrible and you can never forgive them. It’s thinking back on that, and how someone can change so much in such a short time."

“Hot Sugar” conveys the feelings of someone who thinks they’re falling in love for the first time, when in reality they just admire the other person’s cool persona. The narrator has fun with the laid back person, in an attempt to be cool like them, but ultimately they never engage in any real conversation.
There are various pop culture references in the song, along with the musical change up which was inspired by New Orleans Bounce music.

Dave for Atwood Magazine:
“Hot Sugar” is… I think that’s my favorite sonically, I wanted that one at the beginning of the record ’cause it is like… It’s all the sounds kind of coming together, all of the sounds of the record. It’s quite mad, lots of strings, lots of really noodle-y strings on the Mellotron. What can I tell you about that one? I guess that one’s actually about something that… About later in life, really. It’s about a relationship, I don’t know… It’s just admiring somebody and confusing that for love or being kind of in awe of someone and thinking that it’s love or… And going with the relationship for that reason, but really it’s just a kind of… You just kinda wanna be like that person ’cause they’re really cool. We’ve all been there. I don’t know, I think that was when I was like 15 or something. “This person’s so cool.” But really it’s just… Yeah, they dress cool, do cool things, and they make you do cool things.
And on Facebook:
“song explanation of the week….HOT SUGAR. what do y’all wanna know about this one? I dont want to go into too much depth….but loosely….the song is about confusing wishing you were more like someone, with being in love with them. this person is laid back, cool as hell, confident, they can pull off anything, dressed perfectly all the time, etc. and there i am i’m just like….quite neurotic. and you kind of want some elements of their ‘coolness’ to rub off on you. but at the same time you never feel fully comfortable around them. you never have real conversations with eachother. you spend a lot of time getting a bit messed up to try to fix that…and you have a lot of fun…but it aint right. so…there are a lot of bright visual references in this song to things that seem beautiful on the surface, but are either transient, or destined to fail, or deceptive, or lysergic-y/hallucination-y/not real. 
 ie the 70’s lotus esprit… its the ultimate like…little kid’s hotwheels dreamcar. it looks damn cool…but it was notorious for relentlessly breaking in minor ways. it could never actually complete a proper journey. [Also…it was used in a james bond movie (the spy who loved me) as a submarine car (awesome)].
 then there’s hotels, and spaceships being seen in the swimming pool but they’re actually just waves and cool whip that’s delicious but bad for you and the surfacey goodness of perfect skin and pricey perfume. 
 “pool paintings” is another nod to Hockney’s “bigger splash.” think i talked about that as a recurring theme in the dreamland explanation and how the album cover is a play on that painting with the pool and the trees and the diving board.
 the musical switch up came from having a phase of listening to a lot of bounce tunes.”"

“Lady” sampled Chic’s 1982 single “Soup For One”, which was unsuccessful at the time. Chic frontman Nile Rodgers later said:

Tangerine is the second track from Glass Animals' third studio album Dreamland.
The song features Dave singing over a very poppy and cheery instrumental mixed in with the enthusiastic “Woahs” of children, in contrast to the content of the song which reflects the experience of a person who loved someone that has now changed for the worse.
The title of the song comes from the properties of the fruit it is named after. According to Dave Bayley:
The idea of the tangerine is that it’s developed thick bitter skin that tastes like shit. Maybe there’s something nice hidden inside but if you leave it too long the skin just gets harder and more withered and the sweetness inside dries up.
In this context, a tangerine is compared to the one being talked about in the song. A thick, bitter peel, concealing a juicy fruit- but if it’s left alone for too long, all that niceness inside is going to dry up, and you’re left with just the bitterness.

Dave Bayley told FLOOD Magazine that:
“It’s about when someone you’ve known and loved for a long time begins to change for one reason or another, but you can still see those tangerine dots in their eyes from time to time, a glimmer of who they used to be. “Maybe it’s something they say or do. So you keep being attached to this person, this old version of the person that’s actually kind of a wanker now.”"

“Midnight City” is off of M83’s sixth, and critically acclaimed album Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming (Naive, 2011). The song’s catchiness quickly made it one of the most popular songs of the year, appearing on the top of many “Best of” lists. The song is a tribute to city life and the city itself, especially how it comes alive during the nighttime.
Anthony Gonzalez’s comment on the use of the saxophone:
Sometimes a song needs an element to be finished. You know that this element has been overused in the past and is considered clichéd or cheesy, but the song needs it. With this album, the whole idea was to do something and have no regrets.
The music video is a tribute to the movies Village of the Damned and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

“Softcore” is the fifth track on The Neighbourhood’s self-titled third studio album The Neighbourhood.
The track blends a punchy electronic beat with 80s new wave synths to create a catchy, bad-ass alternative pop song. The bridge brings back the familiar chords and guitar progression heard in the second half of “Wiped Out!,” the title track of their sophomore album. Notably, “Softcore” would regain popularity in 2022, after going viral on the social media app TikTok.

Arguably the most sophisticated and lively song on the album, this neo-funk number is extremely catchy. Following in her brother’s footsteps, Willow is experimenting with her own spirituality and growing into a young adult. We follow her into the crevices of her brain, as she lets us in on this transitional point in her life through her unique sound.

“Midnight City” is off of M83’s sixth, and critically acclaimed album Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming (Naive, 2011). The song’s catchiness quickly made it one of the most popular songs of the year, appearing on the top of many “Best of” lists. The song is a tribute to city life and the city itself, especially how it comes alive during the nighttime.
Anthony Gonzalez’s comment on the use of the saxophone:
Sometimes a song needs an element to be finished. You know that this element has been overused in the past and is considered clichéd or cheesy, but the song needs it. With this album, the whole idea was to do something and have no regrets.
The music video is a tribute to the movies Village of the Damned and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

A stand-alone single released during the band’s North-American leg of the Dreamland Tour, “I Don’t Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance)” notably boasts a slick bass riff alongside a danceable breakbeat. Lyrically, the song explores themes of apathy towards a dying relationship. The narrator acknowledges their indifferences by insisting they stop talking and dance instead, leaving their bad memories in the past.
I Don’t Wanna Talk (I Just Wanna Dance) was soon added to the Dreamland (+ Bonus Levels) track list after its release

Quoted by NME, Glass Animals frontman Dave Bayley said:
Talking is great, don’t get me wrong. But this pandemic has made so many of us look inwards in a way we maybe haven’t before…It really fed people’s deepest insecurities and rattled our foundations in so many ways. Relationships changed, friendships altered, and self-confidence was warped…It felt like we were all put in a pressure cooker, but there was no way to let out the steam. That’s what this track is about – that pressure cooker exposing and expanding so many cracks, but struggling to fill them in and decompress. I want people to switch their devices off, put this song on, close their eyes and have that release for a moment.

“Softcore” is the fifth track on The Neighbourhood’s self-titled third studio album The Neighbourhood.
The track blends a punchy electronic beat with 80s new wave synths to create a catchy, bad-ass alternative pop song. The bridge brings back the familiar chords and guitar progression heard in the second half of “Wiped Out!,” the title track of their sophomore album. Notably, “Softcore” would regain popularity in 2022, after going viral on the social media app TikTok.

“Heat Waves” is the fourth single from UK band Glass Animals' third studio album Dreamland. The song features a melancholy tone but maintains high energy through its instrumental, with Dave speaking on remaining strong through vulnerable moments in your life and embracing your vulnerability.
The band first teased the track along their 2020 Déjà Vu Tour, as seen on the setlist for the Toronto show on the tour. Dave then teased the song’s release and chorus lyrics on the band’s subreddit on June 26, 2020. It was later premiered as Annie Mac’s Hottest Record in the World on BBC Radio 1 on June 29, 2020.

After the song released, Dave published a note to fans on Twitter:
HEAT WAVES IS OUT NOW. it’s about realising you can’t make everyone happy. and realising it’s ok to be defeated by something. we are often expected to ‘be strong’ and to swallow our sadness. failing to do that is seen as weakness. so we try to cover up our feelings and hide inside of TV shows or video games or drink or drugs. but being vulnerable should be a positive thing. there was a review in a big publication we got early on that said i was ‘too effeminate’ because of the way I sang and that that was weak and gross. its 2020. there’s no space for that sh*t anymore. the music video is out too. it’s meant to reference the sentiments in the song…about being defeated and unable to save something…but tweaked the context a little. I’ll do another post about it tomorrow explaining more. i hope you like the song, its a special one to me.
He expanded on the meaning in the Apple Music Editor’s Notes:
It began with a personal experience that everyone has had: A friend starts dating someone and slowly, they change the way they dress. And then the way they talk. And then everything. Eventually it gets to the point where you’re like, ‘Who is that? Where did my friend go?’ Well, this song is about realizing that it’s happened to you, that it’s you that’s changed. You’ve become someone that you aren’t. I was trying to figure out whether it’s a good thing or a bad thing, but ultimately I think it’s about hitting a wall—a point where you can’t change anymore or you’ll lose the foundation of who you are. You’ll become an attachment for this other person. It’s happened to me and I’ve seen it happen to so many friends. And there’s a moment when you see your reflection and you’re like, ‘Oh, fuck.’ All of the lyrics play into that—mirages, hallucinations, things like that.
He revealed more about the video’s meaning on YouTube:
this video is a love letter to live music and the culture and togetherness surrounding it. It was filmed at the peak of the lockdown in my neighbourhood in East London by the lovely people who live around me, just using their phones. These are people who are usually out at shows, in galleries, going to cinemas etc. These venues are left empty now, and many of them will not survive. The song is about loss and longing, and ultimately realizing you are unable to save something…and this video is about that but for art, being together, and human contact. Huge love and thank you’s to everyone who got involved and helped out. When everyone was leaning out of their windows filming, I felt that same sense of togetherness and spine-tingling energy that happened at live shows. It made the coldness of performing to an empty room with the band stuck on screens feel even more heart-breaking
Yes, it was certified platinum on April 28, 2021 making it their second song to do so."

“Sweater Weather” is the lead single from The Neighbourhood’s 2012 debut EP I’m Sorry…, and also features on their debut full-length album I Love You.
“Sweater Weather” is one of The Neighbourhood’s most successful tracks, peaking at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts in December 2013 and spent 11 weeks at #1 on the Alternative charts. The music video for the track reached 100 million views in December 2015, when the video was merely two years old.
“Sweater Weather” is the first song the band had ever written together, composed during their first practice, around a year prior to its release. Frontman Jesse Rutherford recalled the historic day to Schon! in December 2015:
It was just a really special moment and it felt special before anybody said it was special. When we first wrote it and showed our families and some friends that we trusted their opinion around town or whatever, it was just a different reaction than we’d ever seen someone have to our music.

[Sweater Weather] has done so much for us and it’s a super solid song, but it was the first one we wrote. We have grown a lot and have gotten our sound more locked in since that song. It still feels right alongside all the other songs but it definitely is the hardest one to put other tracks around.
–Jesse Rutherford via Swide.com on the struggle of articulating his feelings into lyrics on “Sweater Weather”
On June 1, 2013, “Sweater Weather” peaked at #1 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart. It spent 11 weeks at the top spot overall."

“Your Love (Déjà Vu),” described by band frontman Dave Bayley as a “conflicted booty-call anthem,” is about toxic relationships that you know are bad for you but can’t seem to cut off.
Speaking to Annie Mac during the song’s premiere on BBC Radio 1’s Future Sounds, the band’s lead singer and songwriter Dave Bayley explained that he has recently made a major shift from the band’s usual abstract lyrics to more personal ones. He went on to explain that “Your Love” is about a dysfunctional relationship and stated:
“[E]veryone’s got relationships, not necessarily romantic ones, in their lives and they know that that person is kind of bad; it’s an unhealthy relationship – but you keep letting that person back into your life. Either because you think it’s going to change, or because something deeper, darker – you’re addicted to the chaos of that relationship. That’s what this is about – being addicted to the mess.”
Naturally, much of this interview focused on the elephant in the room: drummer Joe Seaward’s life-threatening cycling accident which left him unable to walk or speak–much less play drums–for over a year. His injuries forced Glass Animals to cancel all scheduled tour dates and take an extended hiatus. Initially, the band stayed with him for several weeks. Eventually as Joe’s healing progressed Dave went to the United States where he worked on some solo and collaborative writing and producing projects. He said that working with hip-hop artists who tended to write very personal lyrics inspired him to take a more personal approach to songwriting as well. Thus, the incident that threatened to destroy the band ended up being a catalyst for creative change.
The song first made its live debut during Glass Animals' comeback show at The Bullingdon in late 2019 where the setlist called it “Palm Mute”. Fans in attendance reported that the band  requested for them not to post any videos of this performance online as they were still a bit rusty. They honored the request.
“Your Love (Déjà Vu)” was confirmed to be a single from Glass Animals' upcoming third album, Dreamland, before the album was officially announced.

Dave’s quotes in Dork Magazine expand on the song’s subject:
“I think we’ve all found ourselves in fucked up relationships that make us feel sad and helpless. Not necessarily something romantic – maybe it’s with a family member or a friend. A relationship that we know on some level is going to keep breaking our hearts. We let that person back into their [sic] lives over and over again, even though it always ends the same. Maybe you don’t confront it because you hope it’ll change with time. Or because it’s easier to let it slide and never set boundaries. maybe you think you deserve that unhappiness. Or maybe you find some strange comfort in the chaos.
This song is about that…about being addicted to chaos. About doing or allowing something self-destructive because on some level you get off on the sadness that comes of it. It’s about wanting to float around and exist inside of that feeling because it has always been familiar to you. It’s something that a lot of people know from growing up in a tense household…so it can feel right to create that dynamic, even if you don’t realise you’re doing it.”
Glass Animals explained it with a tweet
…it’s two identical takes. one with a thermal camera. one normal. layered on top of each other. i have a bath. and then i sit in a car even tho i don’t actually have a driving license. and we dance around.

“Electric Feel” is about sex and the “electric” sensations it provides. It also uses electricity to refer to love, and mentions how worldwide love would change the world.
It is MGMT’s second single from the album, Oracular Spectacular, and was named #5 on NME’s Top Singles of 2008 list. This track also appeared in three different video games and two TV shows.
This song really shows just how MGMT is taking the Hippie music of the 60’s and 70’s in a new, modern direction.

A lot of times when we write songs we have had some kind of influence or a style that we really want to put into our music. Like, we’ll say let’s have that part sound like this and that part sound like that and then we piece it all together. We didn’t plan anything, it was more of a song by song thing. We tend to be inspired a lot by artists that switch genres each album. Each song is different. ‘Legendary Pink Dots‘ are like that. When we were writing the album they were a big influence. We literally just wrote whatever came to us. There is a weird combination on the album because it has a couple of older tracks on it which were originally electronic with a more dancey feel. ‘Electric Feel‘ was one of the first songs we wrote, well the first actual song with lyrics.

I was too young to understand why she had blood on her nose…It was one of the toughest to write because it didn’t feel like my story to tell, but it also felt like a story that needed to be told. At the moment, in the current climate where domestic violence has risen so dramatically under lockdown, it’s a topic that feels more important than ever to talk about.

From an interview with NME :
‘One of the songs from the new album, ‘Domestic Bliss’, for example, relays a story about his friend’s mother in an abusive relationship.
“I was too young to understand why she had blood on her nose,” Bayley recalls of the harrowing moment. “It was one of the toughest to write because it didn’t feel like my story to tell, but it also felt like a story that needed to be told.“’
Dave for Apple Music:
This song was sparked by one of my very first memories—the first where I can trace the whole sequence of events. I was maybe six. I went to my friend’s house after school one day, and it was a weird place. There were dogs in cages, wild cats in cages; I didn’t really understand it. We weren’t allowed in the house—we always played in this woodsy area nearby—but sometimes there’d be loud shouting from inside. My friend would turn to me and be like, ‘Oh god, she’s going to come out crying.’ And his mom would come out of the house in tears with blood on her nose and things like that. I remember it hitting me, just that it was so bad. And then we’d all get back in the truck and she’d take me home. I guess the song is about the helplessness you feel in situations like that. When you know it’s bad but also that you’re too young to really get it."

I’m pretty sure the almost seamless transition between the final chord of this song and the one in Domestic Bliss was intentional, as well as the meaning of the placement. This is what I assume to be another one of Dave’s home movies. It’s a sweet memory of his childhood, the accompanying video being a little moment of happiness and spending time with his parents as a young kid. That’s what makes the next track seem more bitter and less hopeful. The narrator in Domestic Bliss’s lyrics seems to be a sort of shadow, a warning that not every story is as simplistic and cheerful as the others. And that pain is often glamourized and ignored until it’s too late.

From FLOOD magazine, frontman Dave Bayley explained, “If you’ve ever said something that you know is going to break that person, then you say it, and it’s almost like an out-of-body experience, and it feels like it’s not you saying it…but then it comes out,” says Bayley. “It’s about the three seconds between you saying it, and then there’s that silence—but it’s also the loudest thing that’s ever happened in your life.”

From the band’s Instagram post:
This entire song is about only three seconds of life. I think most people have been in a position where they have to say something to someone that they know is going to devastate them and change their life forever. It’s about the silence between those words leaving your mouth, and their reaction as those words register and the full weight rolls over them…until they say something back. its probably the most deafening thing I’ve ever experienced. the video is meant to be a physical representation of the build up before that and then the sudden explosion of quiet that seems to last forever.
From the album’s Apple Music page:
This song is about saying something that you know is going to really hurt somebody—something they’ll never forgive you for and that will probably make them hate you—and the three seconds right after you say those words. That silence that feels like the loudest fucking thing ever. I began with a particular moment in mind, but then I just started thinking back on all the times I’ve been…well, maybe not a dick, but close. All the times I’ve hurt somebody, and sitting with what that felt like. It’s quite abstract compared to the rest of the songs on the record because I wanted it to apply to a lot of situations."

“Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth” is about looking back at yourself at the beginning of a relationship and recognising that you were acting completely different to normal. The song was the first to be written for Dreamland after it’s title track. The final version is actually the demo, as the band had tried to re-record it, but ended up sticking with the original.
In the Glass Animals listening party, Bayley says
Someone once told me that for the first 3 months of a relationship, you play a fake version of yourself…I think we spend a lot of time not being ourselves because we think who we are isn’t good enough, so we hide our real selves when actually it would be much better to just be open and honest from the beginning.
